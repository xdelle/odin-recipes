        <h3>Recipe Description</h3> 
           <p>Lightly battered pan-fried chicken breast with an elegant white wine lemon sauce. It's like Chicken Piccata, but a thicker sauce, more of it, no capers, with subtle lemon flavour. It has a terrific crust that soaks up the sauce! Lovely restaurant dish thatâ€™s simple to make at home.</p>And the best part?<p><em>The Possibilities are Endless!!!</em></p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <img src="../ingredients.webp" alt="Chicken Francese Ingredient List" height="250" width="400"

        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breast- preferably as its the cut commonly used for this recipe.</li>
            <li>Chicken stock or broth for making up the sauce.</li>
            <li>Wine; Chardonnay is the best all-rounder cooking wine, in my opinion,for flavour.</li>
            <li>Oil.</li>
            <li>Parsley-for <em>optional</em> garnish.</li>
            <li>Lemon-Cut into slices then pan fried before adding back into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Eggs and Milk- as this is what will be used to make our chicken batter.</li>
            <li>Flour-it will be used to thicken the sauce and also coating the chicken before we dip it in the milk-egg mixture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b><i>How to make Chicken Francese</b></i></h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Cut each breast in half horizontally to form 4 thin steaks in total.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Flour coating -Mix flour, salt and pepper on a plate (I use my fingertips). Coat the chicken in the flour first, shaking off excess, then set aside on a plate while you heat the oil in the pan, ready to cook.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Egg dredge and once the oil is hot, dip the chicken in the egg, coating both sides, then hold it up for a couple of seconds to let the excess drip off.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Put the chicken straight into the pan. Then continue to coat the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Cook the chicken for 3 minutes until golden. Flip, lower heat to medium, then cook for 4 minutes until the chicken is golden (target internal temperature 68Â°C/155Â°F). Then remove onto a plate. The chicken will rest while we are making the sauce. It's ok if it cools down, it will warm up when we put it back in the sauce.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><i>Pan fry lemon slices</i> by cooking the lemon slices for about 1 1/2 minutes until lightly browned or they become soft (usually the latter for me). In this step, the lemon slices are soaking up the tasty bits left in the pan from cooking the chicken (it is called fond). This flavour is then released into the sauce when we pop the lemon slices in at the end.</li>
            <li>Roux -Next, we move onto the sauce. Melt the butter over medium heat then cook the flour for 1 minute to cook out the raw flour flavour. This pasty mixture in the pan is called a roux and this is what thickens the sauce.</li>
            <li><p>Make the sauce - While stirring, slowly pour in half the stock. Keep stirring until the roux is mixed into the stock. Then you can pour the remaining stock in along with the wine, salt and pepper. Then mix to combine.</p>
            <p><em>Lump free!</em> The technique of stirring while you slowly pour in some stock should prevent lumps forming in your sauce. But if you end up with pesky lumps, swish a whisk across the surface of the liquid to remove them, taking care not to scratch the non-stick surface of the pan. Worst case, strain it. ðŸ™‚</p></li>
            <li>Simmer to thicken - Simmer the sauce for around 4 minutes, stirring every now and then, until it thickens into a syrupy consistency.</li>
            <li><p>Finishing - Once the sauce is the right thickness, it's time to bring it all together! With the pan still on the stove, pop the chicken pieces back in along with the lemon slices and let it simmer for about 30 seconds to warm through and bring the flavour together.</p>
                <p>Then spoon sauce all over the chicken, then it's dinnertime!</p></li>
        </ol>
