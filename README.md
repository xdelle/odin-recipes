Hi there!!

My name is Dabelle. A 25 year old Kenyan who has always had an interest in coding. I therefore took the big leap and voila, here we are.

This is my first 'website' project and it will be on Recipes. I am very excited to see what this journey hold for me as i get to learn how to do more cool things.

Additionally, i believe that coding will give my creative mind an outlet of all the ideas i habor and i can't wait to share this journey with you.

In this project, i am hoping to put some of my coding basics to the test and see what i can cook up.

I cant wait to learn more and i am hoping that you will ride along with me in this journey and get the chance to witness my growth.

See you on the other side champ ðŸ˜Œ

xoxo,
Dabz # odin-recipes
